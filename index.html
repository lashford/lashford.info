					<div id="personalinfo">
						<p>
							<B>Who am I?</B> a professional, a technologist, a programmer and generally a bit of a geek.  I'm interested in engineering software, writing quality code and using the most appropriate language to solve the problem. I always endeavour to follow Design Patterns and Programming Principles I have learnt throughout my career to produce technically sound and supportable software.  I feel I have strong communication  skills and am able to communicate to technical and non-technical audience alike, my positive attitude and professionalism help to increase productivity and attitude within any team.
						</p>

						<p>
							I’m an experienced software engineer specialising in the JVM toolset, however I consider myself a polyglot engineer and have utilised several languages and development environmets throughout my career. My commercial experience has exposed me to a range of projects from large Enterprise systems to smaller applications for cutting edge, technology driven Start-ups.  This has given me exposure to large data volumes, distributed systems, event driven architectures, brown and green field development and services integration, spanning technologies and business sectors.  I have worked with clients to produce highly performant scalable and fit for purpose software solutions, sharing my experience of development, design, implementation and interpreting the intricacies of the business domain.  This coupled with my knowledge of Agile techniques help create good communication channels between the business and engineering teams.

					<p>
						I like learning new things, techy things in particular.  I’m often found spending my evenings and weekends hacking together the next “big idea” or trying out some new tech.  I have a RasberyPi based connected home and I'm always looking for ways to add mmore tech to this IOT platfrom.  I enjoy reading and when not ploughing through tech blogs I like to read things that still require the grey matter, from “The God Delusion” to “Chaotic Fishponds”, I think sparking debate amongst my mates in the pub, is a great way to spend the evening.  Without this sounding too much of a cliché, I really do like, Good Food, Good Whisk[e]y, Good Wine and the odd walk in the Countryside.					</p>

					<h4>Jun 2008 - May 2012</h4>
					<h2>Java Developer</h2>
					<h3>Cheshire Data Systems (CDL), Full-Time</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						One of around 20 Software developers using a range of Java / J2EE toolsets to continue the support and development of CDL’s flagship product; Strata – an n-tier, J2EE based, full policy lifecycle enterprise solution for personal lines and commercial insurance brokerages: the team ranges from recent graduates to experienced architects.  I have been involved in several business critical projects from conception through to delivery and have experienced all aspects of SDLC using both waterfall and agile methodologies.  Later projects used Atern Agile methodoligies working to fixed timescales, using timeboxing and iterative development.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							ETLTool : Involved in the design and implementation of a product to migrate Insurance data from a legacy system into the next generation enterprise solution. The application gave exposure to performant loading of large XML files using StAx/JAXB and Java Persistence Annotations(JPA) using Hibernate as the entity provider.  Multi-threaded data processers where created using the Java concurrency toolset to enable high throughput and program efficiency. I gained experience of performance tuning applications using monitoring tools such as JConsole and YourKit. During Go-live I performed first and third line support for the migration application, talking to customers and liaising with business representatives.
						</li>
						<li>
							Email Generation Engine : Created an extension to the document generation system, to enable Html emails to be created within the application.  Incorporated a velocity engine to allow for HTML templating and added functionality to allow Policy information to be added via an internal API call.  Project was an Agile development using fixed timescales, TDD and iterative development, the architecture took advantage of dependency injection creating cohesive, decoupled code.
						</li>
						<li>
							Prescribe / PDF Converter : Invovled in the enhancement and support of a document conversion engine, translating insurance documentation from Prescribe(Kyocera Printer Language) into PDF format using Apache Batik and FOP.  Also created a WebService for intergration into the Enterprise insurance App, and a regression harness for QA testing.
						</li>
						<li>
							Integration Test API – Created a programming interface to facilitate the dynamic creation of realistic test data used by the integration tests of the enterprise system.  Allowing for removal of extensive boiler plate code created for test data construction.
						</li>
						<li>
							General Enhancement and support of the core application, I have been involved in several smaller projects adding functionality to the enterprise system.  This has given me exposure to enterprise technologies including EJB, JMS, Hibernate &amp; JPA, XML, XSLT, JAX-WS, Soap, Tomcat, Weblogic, Ant &amp; Maven.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
					<h4>Jun 2007 - May 2008</h4>
					<h2>Software Developer (Placement Student)</h2>
					<h3>MacPac Ltd, 3 Months + 1 Day Per Week</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						My main task whilst on summer placement was to produce a production scheduling application that would connect to the current order processing system to retrieve all active orders.  The main application provided a interactive Gantt chart for scheduling jobs and was written in VB.net using the ADO framework to connect an Ms Access system.  I also improved the order processing Access system, adding functionality and bug fixing current features. The work I did during the summer was not only professional but extremely valuable to the company, this was highlighted by the <b>Shell Step award</b> I received in recognition. From this I was offered a part-time job whilst I completed my final year at University, developing more software and generally being their IT professional.
